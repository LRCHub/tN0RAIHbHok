Barbie wanna party
like all night
And she lookin' like a zombie
in her Off-White
Yeah, she lookin', yeah,
she lookin' for a hand out
She think 'cause she with me
she in a band now
Pull up in the truck,
pack it up like a limousine
Lookin' like a blast
from the past,
look like Billie Jean
And you're the only ten I see
And I hope you like Hennessy
And why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Aren't you into me?
You only call me on the weekend
You only love me
when we freakin'
You got me jumpin'
off the deep end
You only call me on the
You only call me on the
You only call me on the weekend
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
we was just gettin' started
I don't wanna,
I don't wanna be broken-hearted
Every time
Every time
Every time
Every time
They hit rewind
They hit rewind
They change their mind
Oh,
and why, why, why, why, why
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
Aren't you into me?
Aren't you into me?
Aren't you into me?
Aren't you into me?
And why, why, why, why, why
And why, why, why, why, why
Aren't you into me?
You
You only call me on the weekend
You only love me when we freakin
You got me jumpin'
off the deep end
You only call me on the
You only call me on the weekend
Call me up if you're lonely
See,
I got the keys from my homies
You the baddest one, my trophy
Only you, you, you, you
Only free past midnight
Type of shit don't sit right
Rather be alone and get high, oh
You only call me on the weekend
You only love me when we freakin
You got me jumpin'
off the deep end
You only call me on the
You only call me on the
You only call me on the weekend
Ah-ooh, ah
Oh-ah, ah
